  <p>SpaceX is targeting Sunday, February 28 for launch of 60 <a
  href="/asldkjfsdlkfj">Starlink</a>[](<>) satellites from Launch Complex 39A
  (LC-39A) at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The instantaneous window is at
  8:37 p.m. EST, or 1:37 UTC on March 1.</p> 


  <p>The Falcon 9 first stage rocket booster supporting this mission previously flew on seven missions: the Iridium-8 mission, the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission, and five Starlink missions. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, which will be located in the Atlantic Ocean. One half of Falcon 9’s fairing previously flew on three Starlink missions, and the other half previously supported two Starlink missions.</p>

  <p>Unbounded by traditional ground infrastructure, Starlink can deliver
  high-speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable or
  completely unavailable. At a time when more people are  working from home and
  more students are participating in virtual learning, internet connectivity is
  more important than ever. With Starlink, we’re able to deploy quickly to areas
  that need it most.</p>


  <p>In December, the Wise County Public School District in rural Virginia, where approximately 40% of teachers and students do not have internet access at home, announced it would provide some families in the area with Starlink to support remote learning. Starlink units were deployed in January and over 40 homes are now connected with high-speed internet.</p>


  <p>If you’re interested in service, we recently starting taking orders on a first-come, first-served basis. To reserve your spot in line, head over to \\[starlink.com](http://www.starlink.com) for more information.</p>
